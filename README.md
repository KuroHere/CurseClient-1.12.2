# CurseClient
Minecraft 1.12.2 forge utility mod.

### Reason
personal project made by Kuro_Here, for learning purposes. (This shit not done yet)

### Stories

At first, I intended to sell it,
but when I think about it,
I'm no different from a bad person who took the src code from many places (but I cook it well :^)),
currently I'm quite bored and want to find something new to do, like Curse for fabric?
